This repository contains my full trading system developed during the **IMC Prosperity 3 Trading Simulation Challenge** — a fast-paced, real-time algorithmic trading competition focused on market efficiency, risk management, and profit generation across synthetic and real asset markets.

## 📊 Overview

Throughout the challenge, I designed, implemented, and refined a competitive trading bot capable of:

- Reacting to **live order book data**
- Managing a **multi-product portfolio**
- Exploiting **synthetic vs market price arbitrage**
- Optimizing **spread-based market making**
- Tracking trends and signals to adapt to **shifting market dynamics**

The bot consistently improved over rounds, adapting to increasingly complex instruments and market mechanics introduced in each phase.

## 🔁 Key Rounds & Milestones

| Round | Highlights |
|-------|------------|
| 🥖 Round 1 | Focused on standalone products like CROISSANTS, JAMS, and DJEMBES. Built a price-tracking foundation and implemented first version of the market-making engine. |
| 🧺 Round 2 | Introduced PICNIC_BASKET1 & PICNIC_BASKET2. Created synthetic valuation engines to detect mispriced baskets vs components. Basket arbitrage strategy launched. |
| 🌊 Round 3 | Increased volatility, more products (e.g., KELP). Optimized inventory management, spread-based limit orders, and velocity of execution. Custom logger added for strategy introspection. |
| 🚀 Final Rounds | Combined trend tracking with arbitrage, smarter risk controls, and basket decomposition logic. The bot reached profitability targets of **$50k–$100k** consistently. |
